#About Me

My name is Roy Mosby and I have been in the U.S. Armyâ€™s Signal Corps for almost 15 years. Coming up on 20 years total military service, I am preparing to retire and look into another career. I have a strong history of process improvement with focus on devising alternative strategies for streamlining routine tasks. I have also been recognized by several units for improving organizational productivity and efficiency.

I am almost finished with a Bachelor's in IT and have pursued other educational opportunities to further improve myself. In August, 2014, I attended Army Knowledge Management Course. In September of 2015, I gained Knowledge Management certification through KMPro.
