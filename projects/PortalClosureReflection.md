## IT-489-06: Employ managerial strategies and interpersonal skills to promote success in a high-functioning organization

### IT420: Project closure document- Army division portal migration

This document serves as a post-mortem briefing for a migration project to move 3d Infantry Division and its subordinate units from SharePoint 2010 to 2013. It provides a synopsis of the project and includes artifacts that demonstrate the deliverables of the project. The project closure documents the second half of the same project found in objective #IT489-03 and was executed from October 2016 to February 2017 in IT415 and IT420.
This project focused on the construction and transition phases of the migration, in particular, the final outcomes of the project. It demonstrates my ability to execute on a plan while maintaining the flexibility to make needed adjustments. The distributed nature of this project meant that I had to delegate many of the tasks to the subordinate units then follow-up to ensure completion. It further demonstrates the communication skills necessary to brief stakeholders on progress throughout the latter half of the SDLC.
While I provide the document in full I feel verification plan found in the latter half of the document is the most important part. I use this to outline the approaches used during this project to explain my approach to verify the completion of requirements and deal with changes as they are presented. Since this project had a large footprint (it covered a division staff, five brigades and its subordinate units, several tenant battalions, across two posts) I could not follow up directly with each stakeholder. I instead had to delegate this task to content management reps found at various locations through the command. This section also captures the approach used to capture and process feedback throughout implementation.
During the creation of this document, I leaned the importance of addressing follow-on issues. These could be suggested changes that could not be incorporated into the project (access to the portal from outside the 3ID domain) or issues that had to be addressed separately from the project (both search and web services stopped working but they fell under the purview of the NEC since they handle farm administration). I also discovered that it was important to address support after the project completed and transition into an indefinite maintenance phase. Being able to address these details ensured that there was a clear plan in place for continued support after the completion of the project.
Like objective #IT489-03, communication with dispersed subordinate units presented the greatest challenge. Although communication channels were started between me and unit representatives, some channels broke down resulting in a few units not receiving accurate information on the projectâ€™s status. This led to some mis-understandings about who was responsible for certain tasks  so they went un-completed until noticed. With a project of this size, I expected this to happen and was prepared to deal with these issues so that they did not have an impact on the overall project.
As mentioned previously, if I were to re-approach this project, I would rely more heavily on official communication channels to disseminate information.
