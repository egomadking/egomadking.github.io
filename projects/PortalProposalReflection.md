## IT-489-03: Employ appropriate oral and written communication skills to meet the needs of diverse audiences using oral, print, and multimedia strategies

### IT415: Project proposal- Army division portal migration
This project proposal lays out the course of action for a project to manually transition 3d Infantry Division and its subordinate units from SharePoint 2010 to 2013. It describes the scope of the project, requirements, deliverables, and other project considerations identified during the first half of the system development lifecycle (SDLC).
This project is unique from the others in my portfolio because it is a real-world application of skills developed up to that point. I had the luck that this project executed roughly on the same timeline as IT415 and IT420, from October 2016 to February 2017. My IT capstone classes focused on the SDLC- IT415 addressing inception and elaboration phases while IT420 focused on the construction and transition phases.
This artifact illustrates my communication skills as it involved reaching out to stakeholders to share timelines and requirements. In turn, I collected their feedback in the form of their needs, constraints, and limitations then integrated these elements into a course of comprehensive action presented to leadership for approval.
While the capstone focused on learned skills and not developing new, I gained new insights to the complexities of IT project development. In particular, communication in an distributed, ever-moving environment is a challenge. The hardest part of this project was being able to reliably communicate with all the subordinate units who had differing training schedules. At times, certain units would not receive a request for information or choose not to act in a timely manner on it. They would then be out of sync with the the progress made up to that point.
When the project focus had moved elsewhere, those behind would try to get the shareholders to circle back to an issue that was already addressed and closed for consideration. At points like this, the workgroup emphasized the importance of moving the timeline forward and only stoped with a significant exception arose. Only one such exception came up- that of catching up a unit that had recently came off of deployment after the project started.
Looking back on this project, I would have engaged official communications channels more to get more involvement from the subordinate units. As it stood, only one operational order (OPORD) was delivered addressing the timeline and the requirements of the subordinate units. In hindsight, this OPORD needed to be followed up by continuous fragmentary orders (FRAGORD) outlining more specific details and provide changes to the timeline as needed. The FRAGORDs, because of their nature, would have put the units under additional scrutiny of the Division staff, compelling them to give the project the attention it needed.
Even with these challenges and changes that could have been made, the project proposal was approved, allowing us to move forward into the development phase.
