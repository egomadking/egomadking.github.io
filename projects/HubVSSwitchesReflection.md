### IT340: WK6 business case- Hubs vs switches

This business case argues for the benefits of using switches over  hubs in a business network infrastructure. It uses layman-level language and illustrations to prove the advantages of switches. It outlines the basic operation of both technologies then compares their usage. This document was completed as an assignment for IT340 during April to June of 2016.
While this may be one of the smallest artifacts presented in my portfolio, I think that it’s simplicity plays an important role in the business process. It is often not the case that those who are responsible for financial decisions have a deep understanding of technologies they are asked to invest in. Being able to describe clearly the differences between two networking concepts arms those with decision making power with information to make informed purchase decisions.
I used both written and illustrative approaches to describe how hubs and switches operate. I also provide an explanation of why hubs should not be used anywhere except in smaller environments.
Prior to creating this business case, I first had to understand how hubs and switches operate. I also had to know how network congestion leads to degraded performance and how switches act to minimize it by routing traffic. Since I have professional experience with networking technologies, I knew much of this prior to the start of the class. However, creating this paper was an opportunity to reflect on my knowledge and make a persuasive case for adopting the correct technology for a given need.
If I were to approach this project again, I would likely use a multimedia format, combining video with the written word. Being able to “see” network traffic as it moves through a hub or switch would provide the user with a more engaging learning tool than static images.
