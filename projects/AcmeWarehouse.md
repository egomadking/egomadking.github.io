## Business case

In 2004, ACME Corps installed a wireless network onto its existing infrastructure. Such a move provided the company flexibility by untethering employees from a hard-wired enterprise network. However, with the rate of technological change over the last decade, Acme Corps needs to perform some upgrades to keep up with existing standards.

The original 802.11b equipment is outdated and needs replaced. Originally released in 1991 (Sreekanth, 2008), 802.11b’s primary aim was to be able to establish a wireless network. In order to do so, a lightly regulated frequency of around 2.4 GHz was used. While this provided a signal range of up to 150 feet, it has limitations, most of which has to do with interference and transmit speeds.

The 2.4GHz spectrum contained a total of 11 channels to choose from but there is significant overlap. In fact, if all overlap is to be avoided, only three of the spectrum’s channels can be used- one at the low end, one in the middle, and one at the high end. Even then, 802.11b technologies have to compete with other devices.

Since that part of the spectrum has always been fairly open, other devices use it which could interfere with network operability. Wireless phones, bluetooth, and other short-ranged wireless devices use the band. Microwave ovens, if they are not insulated adequately, also emit a significant amount of noise at this frequency (Fitzpatrick, n.d.) which could further degrade a network using 802.11b.

Several different standards have been developed since then, allowing for greater bandwidth, larger signal reception footprints and less external interference. For the installation recommended, the 802.11n standard is current and provides a lot of improvements over 802.11b.

The two most significant improvements are speed and coverage. At 600 Mbps, 802.11n is over 50 times faster than 802.11b. Transferring data will be much faster, load times for websites decrease, and workers will be able to accomplish more on bandwidth-intensive business applications such as analytic tools and databases. Equipment that use the newer standard can have up to double the coverage of older 802.11b equipment. With 300 feet of coverage, less IT resources are needed to cover the same footprint.

While this newer standard still can operate in the 2.4GHz frequency, 5GHz can be used as well. This spectrum has 23 different channels to choose from, 12 or 6 (depending on implementation) of which do not overlap. This means that more wireless access points can overlap, improving the blanket of coverage. Maintaining 2.4GHz also has the added benefit of remaining backwards compatible with equipment that cannot be upgraded to the newer standard.

Network speed and signal coverage are two important areas that can be improved by investing in a newer standard. By improving them both, Acme Corps will enable its employees to be more productive and maintain the freedom of movement that the already enjoy.
