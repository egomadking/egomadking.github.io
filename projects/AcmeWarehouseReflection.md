## IT-489-04: Recommend effective system design and maintenance solutions that meet user and organizational needs based on appropriate tools and applications for a given scenario

### IT340: WK4 business case- Acme warehouse wireless network upgrade

This justification document provides an upgrade route for ACME Corps’ wireless network infrastructure. It outlines optimal specification choices that meet the the company’s current and future needs. This project was completed during IT340 which I attended April-June of 2016.
It artifact demonstrates an application of material learned in this course to meet a business’ requirements. It provides the business with a a synopsis of its currently adopted wireless standards and the problems encountered in its usage. I use speed, decreased interference, and coverage as arguments to invest in newer technologies.
The Acme warehouse wireless business case required an understanding of current and emerging wireless technologies and how they apply to an enterprise environment. Being able to recommend an upgrade also requires an understanding of a technology’s lifecycle and how it affects business productivity. The technologies recommended also have to endure long enough so that the business sees a return on their investment. It does not good to make recommendations that will only be outdated in the short-term.
Being able to complete this project enhanced my understanding of the topic and served as practice of communication skills. It is not enough to know that one wireless specification is better than another. One must provide a compelling case for upgrade, proving tangible benefits over that which is currently used.
To improve on this artifact if I were to approach it again, I would include several supporting illustrations. One would visualize the channel overlaps at the 2.4GHz and 5GHz frequencies. Another would be a speed graph to show the relative difference between the competing 802.11 standards. It may also be helpful to illustrate the current wireless equipment and its footprint to compare with the changes made in hardware layout for the proposed specification.
